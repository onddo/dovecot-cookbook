# [2023-04-15T02:54:09+00:00] WARN: The Ohai plugin_path does not include /tmp/kitchen/ohai/plugins. Ohai will reload on each chef-client run in order to add this directory to the path unless you modify your client.rb configuration to add this directory to plugin_path. The plugin_path can be set via the chef-client::config recipe. See 'Ohai Settings' at https://docs.chef.io/config_rb_client.html#ohai-settings for more details.
